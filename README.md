## Motivation behind the project 
During my internship in Bangalore, I observed a unique shift in how people commute. Since local auto-rickshaws aren't as readily available or reliable in many parts of the city, people often switch between 3–4 ride-hailing apps just to find a cab—especially during peak hours when demand is high and availability drops.
<b> 
In contrast, I noticed a growing preference for bike taxis, particularly Rapido, which stood out for its convenience, affordability, and trust among both riders and captains. Its ability to meet urban mobility needs efficiently made me curious about how the product works behind the scenes.
<b> 
This led me to take up a product case study on Rapido to explore its user experience, business model, and the strategies driving its rapid growth and customer loyalty.
